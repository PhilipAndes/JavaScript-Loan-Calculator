# Loan_Calculator

Started coding: Dec 2018,

A JavaScript loan calculator project I've made from a Udemy course.

You can calculate your monthly and total payment, and the total interest. 

In the beginning you won't see the results, after the right input you will get a loading gif for 3 seconds and then the results. 

If you give no input you will get an error message that disappears after 2 seconds.
